A state-of-the-art plant health monitoring system that enables plant owners to keep track of their plant's vital signs and health conditions. **Green Guardian** integrates a range of high-quality sensors, including moisture, light, and temperature sensors, to provide accurate information about the plant's environment.

## Purpose and Benefits
The purpose of Green Guardian is to develop an advanced plant health monitoring system that offers a diverse range of methods to track and monitor the well-being of plants in real time. 

The project incorporates various sensors, presets, an alerting methods to cater to the specific requirements of different plants types. It also provides detailed information and visualizations to display the current health status of the plant as well as its historical data.

By providing real-time monitoring and alerts, it allows owners to detect issues early and take prompt action, ensuring optimal plant health. The system's customized presets simplify plant care by providing tailored configurations making the users experiance streamlined and convenient.
